# The backend to use to display websites. qutebrowser supports two
# different web rendering engines / backends, QtWebKit and QtWebEngine.
# QtWebKit was discontinued by the Qt project with Qt 5.6, but picked up
# as a well maintained fork: https://github.com/annulen/webkit/wiki -
# qutebrowser only supports the fork. QtWebEngine is Qt's official
# successor to QtWebKit. It's slightly more resource hungry that
# QtWebKit and has a couple of missing features in qutebrowser, but is
# generally the preferred choice. This setting requires a restart.
# Type: String
# Valid values:
#   - webengine: Use QtWebEngine (based on Chromium)
#   - webkit: Use QtWebKit (based on WebKit, similar to Safari)
